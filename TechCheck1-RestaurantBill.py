# Restaurant Bill 
# You will create a console-based Python program that will calculate the amount of the tip, the tax, and the 
# total amount of a restaurant bill. The program will prompt the user to input the original amount of the bill. 
# The program will then output the amount of the tax (15% of the original amount) and a tip (20% of the original amount). 
# Finally, the program will output the new total of the bill.

#input variable for bill
    bill=input("Please enter your original bill amount: ")
#taxes 15/100
    taxes=15/100
#taxes*bill
    billTax=taxes*int(bill)
#Tip 20/100
    tip=20/100
#Tip*bill
    billTip=tip*int(bill)
#total for bill
    totalBill=int(bill)+billTax+billTip
#print all bill , taxes , tip , and total
